## Overarching Goals

1. Improve Use Experience
    - Convert all graphviz functionality to mermaid as graphviz requires installing external software/adds complexity
    - Begin to consider GUI options and the easiest ways to interface with less technical users
    - Build out more documentation
    - Finalize the JSON spec
2. Finalize Reporting Capabilities
    - Conversion of all reporting to markdown format
    - Replacement of the graphviz visualizations with the mermaid visualizations
    - Adding in more features such as adding the parameters into the mermaid graphics
3. Python Enabled Blocks
    - Working towards building out functionality so that blocks can actually be run in an enviroment after code is mapped to them
    - Will be ideal for things such as building integration testing, running small simulations, and exploratory analysis
4. Python Metaprogramming
    - Adding in the rest of the metaprogramming so that an MSML spec can be easily used to either scaffold or fully build out a cadCAD model
5. Development Improvements
    - Re-organization of library structure for clarity
