# V0.5 Release Plan

## Executive Summary

- About 65 issues have been sorted into 14 milestones to be completed for the release of V0.5.
- The milestones were purposely kept lighter because many of these issues will be "exploding" issues - they will spawn more issues to take care of during the milestones
    - For example, one issue on reporting will spawn many new report types, but these report types are not known yet as part of that issue is defining the necessary apparatus and desired reports
- The next section describes the themes present in this major milestone update followed by a table of all the issues that have been curated

## Themes

1. **Engine Upgrades** - Creation of a looping block, revival/fixing of the split block, entity implementations, economic testing, inline block creation, debug mode and more
2. **Metaprogramming** - The rolling out of the V1 version of metaprogramming functions from MSML into cadCAD; will begin with just porting to simple python code
3. **Reporting** - Reporting will be upgraded with new styles of reports as well as PDF outputs (in addition to the Obsidian vault) for different views on the systems
4. **Improved documentation** - working towards more detailed documentation to improve new user onboarding experience including more fully filling out the github pages documentation for the library
5. **Refactored engine code for clarity** - cleaning up tech debt and re-writing sections of code that have become "overgrown" after too many patches have been applied to them
6. **Convenience Functions** - Things such as automatic JSON documentation writing CI/CD and automatic github issue writing for enhanced MSML project management capabilities
7. **Research** - Research into past projects that sought to accomplish similar things such as simulink as well as greenfield research
8. **Simulation Upgrades** - Some core updates such as allowing for "experiment groups" as well as working on multiprocessing POCs in support of cadCAD (three libraries will be explored with MSML for dogfooding, information on their success will be passed on to the cadCAD team)
