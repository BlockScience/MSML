# MSML v0.2.2 Update

MSML has seen huge progress in the recent months and is currently being used actively on client projects to build automated mathematical specifications. Updates have been patched in for the core engine which changes the underlying structure in some parts but maintains the overall spirit of the library.

## MSML Review

MSML is a library for standardizing the creation of mathematical specifications as JSON objects as well as aiding in the automation of report and visualization creation from these standardized JSON. Please see the [README](../README) for more information.

## Updates from to v0.1.0 to v0.2.2

A total of 103 were closed out over the development cycle, which broadly fall into the following categories:

### Wiring and Blocks
- Policies, mechanisms, etc. are now all sub-classing the newly created base block, which gets in line closer with GDS. They can be seen as semantic enhancements on primitive blocks.
- The specification now uses wiring to piece together different blocks, and through these wirings it infers what blocks call what other blocks
    - There is also checking on domain/codomain mapping and other improvements
- The stack block, parallel block, and split block are now all implemented as types of wiring
- Action transmission channels are now automatically inferred from the wiring blocks specified which gets rid of the need to specify it manually in JSON

### Mermaid Graphics Engine
- Mermaid is now being used as the graphics engine for all the diagrams
- Because mermaid is code that is rendered in markdown, it makes it more easily portable

### Spaces Updates
- Spaces are now class based objects with extended functionality, this was necessary for getting wiring logic working properly.
    - The json spec now also only needs the string for spaces instead of the literal typing which in then maps into the correct class during loading making the library closer and closer to being programming language agnostic
- Two new built in spaces have been created, the empty space for when a block may return no actual space but still call something after, and the terminating space for when we want to signify that no further blocks are called afterwards

### Feature Improvements
- Parameters have the "parameter_class" attribute which denotes specific types of parameters optionally which is of the type system (what you would find in production code of a system), behavioral (for what kinds of behavioral assumptions and distributions there are), and functional (for defining out different functional forms such as swapping in and out policies)
- Adding control action options to allow for different parameterizations of the control actions

### Quality of Life Improvements
- Numerous new assertions and guards on the spec loading

### Root Finding Canonical Example
- A larger canonical example based on root finding has been put together which will be reviewed later in this document
