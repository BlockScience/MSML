# V0.4 Release Plan

## Executive Summary

- The following is the plan for finishing up to V0.4 of MSML
- V0.4 continued to have things added to it as time passed and as such really was a mixed bag of many different improvements and changes.
- This release plan is meant to tie up V0.4 so that the next major release of V0.5 is more aligned to specific goals
- There are also sections dealing with future work plans to be discussed

## Release Plan

- The release plan will focus on the following broad issues:
    - Fixing some high priority bugs
    - Communications related to the release of V0.4 and a release plan for V0.5. As well a plan for reporting capabilities to build out.
    - Convenience functions for removing start repo components
    - Updates to the engine to allow for even more linking to actual code implementations
    - Engine updates for advanced functionality
    - A few nice to have updates to the markdown obsidian reporting
- There is a chance that more functionality gets implemented if client needs or urgent requests come up
