As part of MSML, there are multiple canonical examples which are meant to showcase how the library gets used. The table below describes the features that each one has as well as the level of completion for each.


## Comparison of Canonical Examples

| Description | A template for using MSML. It implements very basic functionality. | An example of building out an agent based simulation for modeling predators and prey based on multiple actions. | A simulation of different root finding techniques and their relative speed/accuracy | A canonical example to showcase how to simulate changing behavioral patterns and their impacts on final results|
