# TPM Pod Presentation

## Executive Summary

- This research note covers the important aspects of MSML as they relate to the technical project manager pod at BlockScience
- The primary question is how can TPMs support building of an MSML spec

## Internal Communications
- Easy filling in of metadata / documentation into MSML spec for tracking / contextualizing

## External Communications
- Easy back and forth with clients to iterate on msml spec vs client spec views

## Documentation & Reporting Outputs

## Design, Modeling & Simulation

## Where TPMs can be Involved

- Information sourcing
- Validation

## An Example TPM Aided Flow

- We will work through an example of how we might break down a simple project with iteration loops involving TPMs
- Our problem statement for this example is: 

### Phase 1 - Information Sourcing & Requirements Engineering


## A Future Flow: BDP -> MSML -> Code Enabled Specs -> MSML Simulations / cadCAD Simulations
