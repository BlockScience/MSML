## Overaching Goals

1. Improve Use Experience
    - Convert all graphviz functionality to mermaid as graphviz requires installing external software/adds complexity
    - Begin to consider GUI options and the easiest ways to interface with less technical users
    - Build out more documentation
2. Finalize Reporting Capabilities
    - Conversion of all reporting to markdown format
    - Replacement of the graphviz visualizations with the mermaid visualizations
