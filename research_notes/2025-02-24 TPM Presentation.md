# TPM Pod Presentation

## Executive Summary

- This research note covers the important aspects of MSML as they relate to the technical project manager pod at BlockScience
- The primary question is how can TPMs support building of an MSML spec

## Internal Communications

- The primary way that MSML can aid internal communications is through having one working copy of the current specification of the system
    - It is highly recommended to use a git repository so that changes can be tracked easily for the different components
- The "Documentation & Reporting Outputs" covers the ways in which the spec itself can be put into many representations depending on the depth one wants to go in understanding the system generally or specific wirings and blocks
- Also important to note, the spec can be iteratively filled in - for example one could scaffold out only the blocks and spaces first, present the current wirings for confirmation to team members and only then begin to iterate on describing each component
- The example flow will make it clear how all these things could play out together

## External Communications

- The pieces from "Documentation & Reporting Outputs" are also meant to be client facing, but one can decide what is shown
- For example, a session with a client might revolve around one specific wiring in which case the obsidian vault could be utilized to show the wiring but also have the ability to poke into the components

## Documentation & Reporting Outputs

- **Obsidian Vault**:
- **Glossary Report**:
- **Additional Work-in-Progress Reports**:

## Design, Modeling & Simulation

## Where TPMs can be Involved

- Information sourcing
- Validation

## An Example TPM Aided Flow

- We will work through an example of how we might break down a simple project with iteration loops involving TPMs
- We will leverage the current canonical example in progress - the Predator Prey model

### Phase 1 - Information Sourcing & Requirements Engineering


## A Future Flow: BDP -> MSML -> Code Enabled Specs -> MSML Simulations / cadCAD Simulations
