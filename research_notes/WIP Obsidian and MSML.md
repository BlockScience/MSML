# Obsidian, the Mathematical Specification Mapping Library, and End-to-End Modeling

<p><b>7/3/2024</b></p>

Created as a presentation for the BlockScience governance pod.

## Executive Summary

End-to-end modeling often creates information overload because of how many different stakeholders and paradigms it touches on. There are so many different considerations one might take into account such as economic incentives, feasibility or complexity for software development or data storage/processing concerns just to name a few. Both Obsidian and MSML serve as tools to help organize thoughts across the end-to-end modeling process. 

### And how does this apply to governance?

While it will be weaved in throughout this presentation, the high level relations to governance are:
1. Obsidian can be used as a tool for collating the artificats of different groups and linking them together to support interdisciplinary collaborations in an organic way
2. Both Obsidian and MSML can be used as a log of prior work that went into decision making so that different stakeholders can quickly see and understand the context
3. MSML functions as living documentation of systems, and as such stakeholders can quickly see what past implementations or options were (through the policy options) as well as what the current documentation of the system is
