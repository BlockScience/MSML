## Executive Summary

## The Evolving Objectives of the Mathematical Specification Mapping Library Project

### Prior Objectives

- "Writing mathematical specifications can be a difficult process, especially when variable names are changed or new mechanisms are introduced. MSML seeks to streamline the process with automations as well as enhance the abilities of static math specs to deliver deeper insights. Because it is automated, one can write specifications at different levels of details or for different purposes."
- Ideation Tool for Client + R&D Work
- Accelerates cadCAD Modeling
- Bridges GDS and Software Implementation

A[JSON Object \n\n Each spec has a repo for tracking changes \n Must conform to the json specification \n Defines all aspects of the spec including blocks, spaces and actions] -->B[MSML Object \n\n JSON file is parsed, with validations and mappings along the way \n Can show different views on the fly]
    B --> C[Report Outputs \n\n Automatically build reports for the full spec or subviews \n Example: all blocks with an effect on variable XYZ]

```

### Evolving Objectives

- MSML as a Rosetta Stone between groups, programming languages and paradigms
- MSML as a tool to enhance iterative development in end-to-end / full life-cycle systems engineering
