# MSML v0.2.2 Update

MSML has seen huge progress in the recent months and is currently being used actively on client projects to build automated mathematical specifications. Updates have been patched in for the core engine which changes the underlying structure in some parts but maintains the overall spirit of the library.

## MSML Review

MSML is a library for standardizing the creation of mathematical specifications as JSON objects as well as aiding in the automation of report and visualization creation from these standardized JSON. Please see the [README](../README) for more information.
