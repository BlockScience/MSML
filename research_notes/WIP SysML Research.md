# SysML Research Note

## SysML Overview

The systems modeling language (SysML) is a general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering applications. It supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems-of-systems. SysML was originally developed by an open source specification project, and includes an open source license for distribution and use. SysML is defined as an extension of a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) using UML's profile mechanism. The language's extensions were designed to support systems engineering activities.[^1]

- It conforms to IEEE 1471, which is IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems

## MSML vs. SysML

## Action Items

- Explore UML more to further the ideation process
- Possibly explore IEEE 1471, which is IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems
