Getting started with your first MSML specification can seem like a daunting task but this short guide will hopefully make it easier.

## 1. Review the Concepts

- Within this documentation, you can find specific technical documentation including the background theory and the components under "Technical Documentation"
- Feel free to go as deep into it as you feel necessary; if you prefer just jumping straight in you can move on to step 2 or step 3

## 2. Review Canonical Examples & Tutorials

- Within this documentation, you can find a section "Canonical Examples" which has links to examples and tutorials on how to use MSML

## 3. Fork the MSML Template

- The [MSML Template](https://github.com/BlockScience/MSML-Template) can be forked by pushing the green button labeled "Use this template"
- The template comes with starter "DUMMY" components to show the format of a repository
