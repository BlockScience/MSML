### Comparison of Canonical Example Features

| Feature/Attribute | MSML Template | Predator Prey | Root Finding | Retirement Planning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description | A template for using MSML. It implements very basic functionality. | An example of building out an agent based simulation for modeling predators and prey based on multiple actions. | A simulation of different root finding techniques and their relative speed/accuracy | A canonical example to showcase how to simulate changing behavioral patterns and their impacts on final results|
