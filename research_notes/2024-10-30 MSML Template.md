# MSML Template Presentation

## Executive Summary

- The MSML template is a first draft at a git template that can be used and forked to create MSML projects
- There is a separate repository holding the template and it is now linked in the examples folder as a git submodule
- The template works through the entire MSML workflow from crafting a spec to running MSML simulations
- It is important to note that one can pick the point where they move on from MSML; you are not required to bind any code or build out any simulation models

## MSML Template Purpose

- Standardize the workflow of writing MSML models
- Serve as an easy to understand repository for getting set up an MSML repository
- Perform integration testing by re-loading the repository on any major library updates

## MSML Template Repository Presentation

- We can jump over to the MSML template repository [here](https://github.com/BlockScience/MSML-Template) to learn more about the specifics

## Next Steps

- Updating the remove stater repository functionality to be able to remove the new template components
- Gathering feedback and integrating into the template
