# V0.3.2 Proposals Research Note

The following sets up a few proposals for improvements to MSML.

## Parameter Class Names/Descriptions

## SysML Ideas

## Metrics as Blocks Implementation

- Keep stateful metrics and metrics separate
- Metrics will be blocks that are specified in the wirings as they require a domain passed to them (think things like the trades that just happened or summary statistics inputs)
