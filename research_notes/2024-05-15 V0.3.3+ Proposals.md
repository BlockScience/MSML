# V0.3.3+ Proposals Research Note

The following sets up a few proposals for improvements to MSML to be presented to stakeholders for the next coming versions of MSML.

## Parameter Class Names/Descriptions

- There is a [research note](https://github.com/BlockScience/MSML/blob/main/research_notes/2024-05-03%20Parameter%20Class%20Naming.md) that was put together to describe the current issue
- If the following proposal is still lacking, one option is to add another issue for further research into parameters. For example looking up how other simulation frameworks break down parameters or looking into different taxonomies of parameters that are present in academic disciplines such as systems engineering.
- There are many overlaps of potential words to use between these categories. Operational to one person might mean the system parameters versus to another person it might mean the functional parameters.
- System Parameters could be called:
    - System
    - Control
    - Operational
- Behavioral Parameters could be called:
    - Behavioral
    - Enviromental
    - Exogenous
    - Uncertainty
    - Behavioral Strategies
    - Random
    - Stochastic
- Functional Parameters could be called:
    - Functional
    - Operational
    - Technical
    - Implementation
- We could also break down behavioral parameters to one for behaviors of people based on local state/thinking and randomness parameters for things that we don't model behaviorally but use assumptions on


### Proposed Solution
- Add no new parameter classes yet
- Consider breaking out the behavioral parameter into the two described above, but bias towards not doing it for now
- System Parameters -> Control Parameters
- Behavioral Parameters -> Enviromental Parameters
- Functional Parameters -> Implementation Parameters
- Create an issue to change all logic within the MSML library to support the name change
- Spin up a separate issue for updating all canonical examples to function with this

## Metrics as Blocks Implementation

- Keep stateful metrics and metrics separate
- Metrics will be blocks that are specified in the wirings as they require a domain passed to them (think things like the trades that just happened or summary statistics inputs)

### Proposed Solution
- Modify metric class to be a subclass of block now
- Add metrics into wirings just as one might have any other block
- For now don't add codomain coming out of it but create a future issue to figure out what to do with output. There is a separate issue on figuring out if we should have logging functionality or something displayed. These metrics could also potentially be used as inputs to the following block.
- This solution will be a lot of work, but hopefully worth it, so it is important to ensure this path forward makes sense to everyone
- Will also spin up a separate issue for updating all canonical examples to function with this

## New Features from Client Spec Review

- Both of these new features are not high priority at the moment but have been added to the issues backlog
- Issue 1: Look into codifying the $i \in I$ with global state to see if there is a way to automatically have lowercase and uppercase symbols line up for subscripting like user_i in the group of I users.
- Issue 2: Consider how MSML might be able to support relationship mappings. There is a lot of models that rely on this kind of thing and also there are two good follow-ups: allocation tables in SysML and how SQLAlchemy takes care of relationships.

## Latex Escape Characters

- The [Latex Escape Characters research note](https://github.com/BlockScience/MSML/blob/main/research_notes/2024-05-15%20Latex%20Escape%20Characters%20Issue.md) details the issue and possible solutions for this

### Proposed Solution

- Use option 4 from the research note and create a parser that optionally takes escape characters like \f and converts them to \\\f


## 6/3/2024 Meeting Notes

- Actions and thoughts resulting from meeting of Z and Sean
- For the behavioral/system/functional tags on parameters, there should be an option to just specify no tag. Added issue to the backlog
- It would be nice to have local parameter tag ontologies
    - Users would have the ability to use an off the shelf onotology such as Behavioral/Functional/System or create their own -> Issue Added
    - Would probably need to keep functional parameters in all of them for the control flow logic with policy options however
- Parameter Tag Ontology Library / Presets, create a library of parameter tag ontologies that a user can grab off the shelf to use -> Issue Added
- Gameplan is to keep Functional/System/Behavioral for now and just go straight into the local ontology feature at a later point
- Stateful metrics and metrics might be confusing and there should be work on possibly updating the nomenclature / making a very clear guide on the differences -> Issue added
    - Stateful metrics can be thought of as a "view", able to be computed at any time versus metrics need a domain to be fed in for computation
- Before I roll my own solution for the latex parsing issue, investigating MathJax or if there are any external libraries I can use is a good idea -> Issue for this version added
- Work on making it so blocks can be more general, similar to how parameter tagging should be flexible -> Issue Added
