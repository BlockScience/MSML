# V0.4 Roadmap

The current V0.4 roadmap is tentatively planned out as 9 releases spanning 73 issues. There are also 40 issues marked as issues for the next project plan. 

## Overarching Goals

1. Improve Use Experience
- Convert all graphviz functionality to mermaid as graphviz requires installing external software/adds complexity
- Begin to consider GUI options and the easiest ways to interface with less technical users
- Build out more documentation
- Finalize the JSON spec
2. Finalize Reporting Capabilities
- Conversion of all reporting to markdown format
- Replacement of the graphviz visualizations with the mermaid visualizations
- Adding in more features such as adding the parameters into the mermaid graphics
3. Python Enabled Blocks
- Working towards building out functionality so that blocks can actually be run in an enviroment after code is mapped to them
- Will be ideal for things such as building integration testing, running small simulations, and exploratory analysis
4. Python Metaprogramming
- Adding in the rest of the metaprogramming so that an MSML spec can be easily used to either scaffold or fully build out a cadCAD model
5. Development Improvements
- Re-organization of library structure for clarity
- Add in CI/CD
6. Conduct Pure Research
- Comparisons to current alternatives
- Build a sheet detailing the different options out there and the use cases for MSML versus those
7. Expand Features
- Feature discussions on improvements to the core functionality
- Quality of life improvements
- Greenfield development on things such as cadCAD.jl metaprogramming

## Project Plan, MSML V0.4

- The project plan can be viewed [here](https://github.com/orgs/BlockScience/projects/29/views/1).
- The first view shows the issues grouped into the broad buckets of issue types. The second view shows the buckets of V0.3.1 - V0.4.0 as well as V0.4+ (for bumping to the next project plan). The third view shows a table combining the two.
- All comments are welcome on which issues to prioritize for V0.4!
